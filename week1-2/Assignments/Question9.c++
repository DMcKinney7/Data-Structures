Question 9: The Great Pizza Order Automation [15 points]

Assume that you are offered an internship position and your first job is to write a C++ program for a restaurant. The program is used for automating its pizza ordering process. So, your mission is to write a C++ program to help the staff process customer orders efficiently while keeping things light-hearted and fun. 
Requirements:

    Create a Menu:
        Use arrays to store a list of pizza types (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, Veggie Supreme, etc.) and their corresponding prices.
        Display the menu to the user in a stylish and humorous format.

    Take an Order:
        Prompt the user to enter the number corresponding to their pizza choice and the quantity.
        Add a random joke about pizza whenever they select an item (e.g., “Why did the pizza maker become a comedian? Because they know how to deliver!”).

    Calculate the Total:
        Use a loop to allow the user to order multiple items.
        Keep track of the total cost and display it at the end.

    Apply Discounts:
        If the total exceeds $50, apply a 10% discount and let the customer know with a celebratory message like, “You’re a pizza pro—discount unlocked!”

    Extra Credit (Optional):
        Use a function to display a summary of the order, including the total number of pizzas and their final cost after discounts.
        Add a surprise “Chef’s Special” item if the order total hits an odd number.
